Intro about me

## Design

First when the user enters the site will be an office. Inside office I will be sitting in there typing something.

I will stand up and look at the user to say welcome.

User can walk around the office to interact and find items contain info about myself. This will be books or resume, even photos. If possible I will stand by side and explain about the item.

- User can go out the door to dive into my mind. There will be multiple scenes to show that the traits of my personality and my childhood background.
